# simple-ppm-viewer README

Displays `.ppm` files within vscode.
I built it to be able to easily display the generated images from the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) tutorial.
The existing extensions didn't work for me.

## Features

- Only supports `P3` images
